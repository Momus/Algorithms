# Introduction 
This is my public repo for working through the Robert
Sedgewick Algorithms course. It is designed to be used with Maven, and
Algorithms.org should have lots and lots of info.


## Solutions to Graded Problems
To comply with the Honor Code, the
solutions to graded exercizes are specifically excluded. The first
section of the .gitignore file lists them explicitly.
